## Introduction

Brief introduction of the use case.
Recommend format: As a <Reader | who will benefit from the use case> I would like to <what is the use case> so that <how will benefit from the use case>

## Detail

* What is the current problem.

More specific is better to help people understand.

* If the use case has specific audience or circumstance then who, when and how will people benefit from solving this problem. 

## Proposal (if any)

Use case does not need to come with proposal or recommendation. But if there is any we can have it documented.
