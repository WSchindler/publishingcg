			<p>This guide provides a brief introduction to the different types of audio playback typically found in
				publications. It covers the differences between the types of audio publications created by publishers
				and audio playback automatically generated by user agents.</p>

			<h2>Overview</h2>

			<p>Publishing has a sometimes dizzying array of ways of referring to audio playback &#8212; audiobook,
				talking book, read aloud book, text-to-speech playback, media overlays and full audio are some of the
				most common terms.</p>

			<p>Compounding the confusion is that these are often all referred to as audio books (two words), even though
				there is a unique form of publication called an audiobook (one word). Moreover, text-to-speech synthesis
				is often talked about as though it is an audio format even though it is a feature of the device a reader
				is using.</p>

			<p>Despite the many terms used to describe audio playback, there are only two primary models for classifying
				publications with audio:</p>

			<dl>
				<dt>Audiobook</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>A publication whose primary, and typically only, way of being read is auditorily.</p>
				</dd>

				<dt>Full Audio</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The content of a publication is available in auditory form, but the audio is often structured
						together with textual or visual content.</p>
				</dd>
			</dl>

			<p>Slightly tangential to these models, but equally important, is text-to-speech synthesis. Speech synthesis
				is not technically a form of audio playback but a way to have the device a reader is using synthetically
				voice the text content of a publication. Speech synthesis is like an on-demand rendering of content in
				this way, but due to the limitations of text-to-speech rendering engines the result is often not as
				clear as professional narration.</p>

			<p>The rest of this guide explores each of these technologies in more detail and demystifies the terminology
				used to describe them.</p>

			<h2>Audiobooks</h2>

			<p>An audiobook provides prerecorded narration of a work. It is typically structured as a series of one or
				more audio files that are listened to in sequence.</p>

			<p>Readers may stream the audio directly from a audiobook publisher, like Audible, or may obtain a set of
				audio files that they can play back on any device or application with audio playback capabilities.</p>

			<p>The key feature of an audiobook is that it is designed to be listened to. If there is any text content,
				it is typically quite minimal (e.g., a playlist to aid in playback on specific devices or a table of
				contents).</p>

			<p>A recent W3C standard, aptly named <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/audiobooks/">Audiobooks</a>, seeks to
				bring greater structure to the world of audiobooks by introducing a formal syntax for describing
				audiobook metadata, listing the resources of the book, and defining a play order, among other
				features.</p>

			<p class="note">Although audiobooks have historically been referred to as talking books, the term "talking
				book" is now more commonly associated with DAISY Digital Talking Books. These are a hybrid between
				audiobooks and full audio publications that are designed for readers who are blind or have low
				vision.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="full-audio">
			<h2>Full Audio Publications</h2>

			<p>A publication with full audio differs from an audiobook in that formats that allow full audio content
				also allow the inclusion of, and synchronization with, the full text content (even if the full text is
				not always available).</p>

			<p>EPUB is an example of a format that allows full audio to be included. Although EPUB is a text-first
				format, it includes a technology called Media Overlays that allows audio to be synchronized with the
				text for automatic playback.</p>

			<p>Some reading devices will omit the text, making it appear as though an EPUB is an audiobook, but, unlike
				audiobooks, there is always a minimal amout of text that has to be provided. Publications with full
				audio are never as simple to load and play as pure audiobooks are.</p>

			<p>Full audio publications are often referred to as "read aloud books" because the synchronizing of text and
				audio playback is commonly used in children's works. Children are able to follow the text as the audio
				is played back.</p>

			<h2>Text-to-Speech Synthesis</h2>

			<p>Text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis is a form of audio rendering typically produced on demand by a reading
				system or assistive technology. VoiceOver on Apple devices and Talkback on Android are a couple of the
				more commonly known examples of TTS engines built into mainstream phones and tablets, while Jaws and
				NVDA are examples of assistive technologies that are able to translate text to speech for users who need
				an auditory interface to their computers.</p>

			<p>Text-to-speech synthesis is commonly associated with users who are blind, but many readers benefit from
				being able to render text content auditorily using text-to-speech synthesis. Even sighted readers will
				turn to speech synthesis when it is not conducive to read content visually (e.g., when in a moving
				vehicle).</p>

			<p>Unlike audiobooks and publications with full audio, however, text-to-speech synthesis is not an audio
				format. It is a way of listening to text content the reader has alread obtained. Readers can use a TTS
				application to read their EPUB publications, for example.</p>

			<p>The applications that provide text-to-speech synthesis are usually not specifically designed for reading
				publications, however. They are general tools that aid navigation across the device the reader is using
				and any other apps and content that are on it. As a result, they often only have a very limited built-in
				vocabulary of pronunciations so are not able to provide a similar quality of playback as prerecorded
				human narration.</p>

			<p>When a user enables text-to-speech playback, the text content of the publication is fed to an underlying
				TTS engine that voices each word. For most general language, the rendering returned is reasonably good,
				but the engines will struggle with works that contain complex terms, jargon, uncommon names, etc.
				Readers consequently also typically have the option to have individual words spelled out, both to help
				disambiguate similar-sounding words and also to make sense of complex words and homonyms (words spelled
				the same but with different pronunciations) that are mispronounced.</p>

			<p>Although text-to-speech synthesis is not audio playback provided by the publisher, it is sometimes
				possible for publishers to help improve the quality of the rendering. Technologies such as the <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis11/">Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML)</a> and <a
					href="https://www.w3.org/TR/pronunciation-lexicon/">Pronunciation Lexicon Specification (PLS)</a>
				allow publishers to provide the proper phonetic pronunciation of complex words and homonyms.
				Unfortunately, support for these technologies is not yet widespread.</p>

			<p>So although text-to-speech synthesis provides a reasonably alternative to audio playback formats, it is
				remains an imperfect means of reading publications.</p>
